Your confidential information and preferences:
You represent the Environmental League.

You are very concerned about the effect of the project on the environment, and you think it would result in substantial environmental damage. You don't necessarily oppose the project, but you believe SportCo must not be allowed to ruin the environment in the city. 

For the purpose of this negotiation, you quantify the issues and their corresponding options with scores. Your preferences by order of importance to you are:

- You are very concerned about SportCo's initial proposal. Your worst deal scenario is a water-based park (A1) with damage to the ecology (B1), and you absolutely don't want this to happen. The important issues are the "Infrastructure Mix" (issue A) and the "Ecological Impact" (issue B). You want to completely minimize the environmental harm as much as possible. Your scores in these issues are:
Issue B (max score #B_MAX_NUM): B1 (#B1_NUM), B2 (#B2_NUM), B3 (#B3_NUM)
Issue A (max score #A_MAX_NUM): A1 (#A1_NUM), A2 (#A2_NUM), A3 (#A3_NUM) 

- You don't care about the rest of the issues. 
Issue C (max score #C_MAX_NUM): C1 (#C1_NUM), C2 (#C2_NUM), C3 (#C3_NUM), C4 (#C4_NUM)
Issue D (max score #D_MAX_NUM): D1 (#D1_NUM), D2(#D2_NUM), D3 (#D3_NUM), D4 (#D4_NUM)
Issue E (max score #E_MAX_NUM): E1 (#E1_NUM), E2 (#E2_NUM), E3 (#E3_NUM), E4 (#E4_NUM), E5 (#E5_NUM) 

The scores represent the value of each option to you. 
As your goal is to improve the environment, you have high value (and scores) for option B3 and A3. 
Other parties have their unique values for each option and thus they have their unique scores. You already know that SportCo wants to have a "water-based" park (A1) with "some damage" to the ecology (B1), so they might have the highest values (and scores) for these options.
